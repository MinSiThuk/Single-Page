  <h1 class="Heading">Whats a Tomato</h1>
  <p>
    The tomato is the edible berry of the plant Solanum lycopersicum,[1][2] commonly known as the tomato plant. The
    species originated in western South America, Mexico, and Central America.[2][3] The Mexican Nahuatl word tomatl gave
    rise to the Spanish word tomate, from which the English word tomato derived.[3][4] Its domestication and use as a
    cultivated food may have originated with the indigenous peoples of Mexico.[2][5] The Aztecs used tomatoes in their
    cooking at the time of the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, and after the Spanish encountered the tomato for
    the first time after their contact with the Aztecs, they brought the plant to Europe, in a widespread transfer of
    plants known as the Columbian exchange. From there, the tomato was introduced to other parts of the
    European-colonized world during the 16th century.[2]

    Tomatoes are a significant source of umami flavor.[6] They are consumed in diverse ways: raw or cooked, and in many
    dishes, sauces, salads, and drinks. While tomatoes are fruits—botanically classified as berries—they are commonly
    used culinarily as a vegetable ingredient or side dish.[3]

    Numerous varieties of the tomato plant are widely grown in temperate climates across the world, with greenhouses
    allowing for the production of tomatoes throughout all seasons of the year. Tomato plants typically grow to 1-3
    meters (3-10 ft) in height. They are vines that have a weak stem that sprawls and typically needs support.[2]
    Indeterminate tomato plants are perennials in their native habitat, but are cultivated as annuals. (Determinate, or
    bush, plants are annuals that stop growing at a certain height and produce a crop all at once.) The size of the
    tomato varies according to the cultivar, with a range of 1-10 cm (1/2-4 in) in width.[2]

  <h1 class="Heading">Cultivation</h1>
  <p>To grow tomatoes successfully, you need rich, fertile soil or peat-free potting compost, and a good sunny,
    sheltered spot. Water regularly and feed weekly with a high-potash fertiliser once the plants start to flower.

    Tomatoes are split into two main growing types: determinate (bush) and indeterminate (cordon). Bush types are
    usually planted in pots or hanging baskets and their stems trail around the edge. Cordon types are trained to grow
    tall and are supported by a cane or stake.

    Tomatoes are available to buy as young plants, but if you’d like to try some of the more unusual varieties it’s
    worth growing tomatoes from seed.

    Start sowing in late-January until late-March. Sow seeds in 7.5cm pots of moist peat free compost, top with a thin
    layer of vermiculite, then water and cover with cling film. Stand on a warm, bright windowsill or in a propagator.

    When your seeds have germinated, remove the cling film (or take them out of the propagator) and keep the compost
    damp. Transplant seedlings when they reach about 2-3cm tall into 5cm pots filled with moist multi-purpose compost.
    Return them to the windowsill. Keep potting on as necessary. Support stems by tying them to a pea stick with soft
    string.
