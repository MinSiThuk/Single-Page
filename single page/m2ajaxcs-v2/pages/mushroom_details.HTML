    <h1 class="Heading">Whats a Mushroom</h1>
    <p>
        A mushroom or toadstool is the fleshy, spore-bearing fruiting body of a fungus, typically produced above ground,
        on soil, or on its food source. Toadstool generally denotes one poisonous to humans.[1]

        The standard for the name "mushroom" is the cultivated white button mushroom, Agaricus bisporus; hence the word
        "mushroom" is most often applied to those fungi (Basidiomycota, Agaricomycetes) that have a stem (stipe), a cap
        (pileus), and gills (lamellae, sing. lamella) on the underside of the cap. "Mushroom" also describes a variety
        of other gilled fungi, with or without stems, therefore the term is used to describe the fleshy fruiting bodies
        of some Ascomycota. These gills produce microscopic spores that help the fungus spread across the ground or its
        occupant surface.

        Forms deviating from the standard morphology usually have more specific names, such as "bolete", "puffball",
        "stinkhorn", and "morel", and gilled mushrooms themselves are often called "agarics" in reference to their
        similarity to Agaricus or their order Agaricales. By extension, the term "mushroom" can also refer to either the
        entire fungus when in culture, the thallus (called a mycelium) of species forming the fruiting bodies called
        mushrooms, or the species itself.

    <h1 class="Heading">Cultivation</h1>
    <p>Mushrooms are best grown under-cover, where temperature and moisture can be controlled. A shed, garage, garden
        cold frame or cellar will work well – anywhere out of the sun where it's possible to give mushrooms their
        optimum growing temperature of around 15°C (the temperature shouldn’t go below 10°C or above 20°C). Outside,
        grow mushrooms in beds, on compost heaps, or in logs, again away from sunlight.
        A rich, fertile, moisture-retentive growing medium is needed for mushrooms. The traditional material for growing
        mushrooms is horse manure and you can buy this from your local garden centre or nearby stables. If the manure is
        fresh, pile it into a heap and fork it over to mix well every couple of days for a fortnight until the heap has
        cooled and settled.

        Ensure the growing medium is moist. Spread the spawn across the surface and mix it 5-8cm deep, then cover with
        damp newspaper. After several weeks when white thread-like mycelium has appeared, take off the newspaper and
        cover the mycelium with a 2-3cm layer made up of 50 per cent garden soil or compost mixed with 50 per cent lime.
        Water as required to keep this evenly moist, using either a hose fitted with a spray attachment, or a watering
        can fitted with a fine rose. Mushrooms should start appearing from several weeks after sowing.
