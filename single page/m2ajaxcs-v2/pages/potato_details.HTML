  <h1 class="Heading">Whats a potato</h1>
  <p>The potato is a starchy tuber of the plant Solanum tuberosum and is a root vegetable and a fruit native to the
    Americas. The plant is a perennial in the nightshade family Solanaceae.[2]

    Wild potato species can be found from the southern United States to southern Chile.[3] The potato was originally
    believed to have been domesticated by Native Americans independently in multiple locations,[4] but later genetic
    studies traced a single origin, in the area of present-day southern Peru and extreme northwestern Bolivia. Potatoes
    were domesticated there approximately 7,000-10,000 years ago, from a species in the Solanum brevicaule
    complex.[5][6][7] In the Andes region of South America, where the species is indigenous, some close relatives of the
    potato are cultivated.

    Potatoes were introduced to Europe from the Americas by the Spanish in the second half of the 16th century. Today
    they are a staple food in many parts of the world and an integral part of much of the world's food supply. As of
    2014, potatoes were the world's fourth-largest food crop after maize (corn), wheat, and rice.[8] Following millennia
    of selective breeding, there are now over 5,000 different types of potatoes. Over 99% of potatoes presently
    cultivated worldwide descend from varieties that originated in the lowlands of south-central Chile.[9] The
    importance of the potato as a food source and culinary ingredient varies by region and is still changing. It remains
    an essential crop in Europe, especially Northern and Eastern Europe, where per capita production is still the
    highest in the world, while the most rapid expansion in production since 2000 has occurred in southern and eastern
    Asia, with China and India leading the world in overall production as of 2018.

    Like the tomato, the potato is a nightshade in the genus Solanum, and the vegetative and fruiting parts of the
    potato contain the toxin solanine which is dangerous for human consumption. Normal potato tubers that have been
    grown and stored properly produce glycoalkaloids in amounts small enough to be negligible to human health, but, if
    green sections of the plant (namely sprouts and skins) are exposed to light, the tuber can accumulate a high enough
    concentration of glycoalkaloids to affect human health.[10] The discovery of acrylamides in starchy foods in 2002
    led to international health concerns, but subsequent high-quality evidence showed acrylamide is not likely to cause
    cancer in humans

  <h1 class="Heading">Cultivation</h1>
  <p>
    Plant seed potato segments cut-side down (eyes up) in a 6-inch-deep hole or trench. Space each segment 12-inches
    apart on all sides.

    Between each segment, sprinkle 2 tablespoons of a low-nitrogen, high-phosphorous fertilizer. Then cover both
    potatoes and fertilizer with 2-inches of soil, and water the soil well.
    new potatoes form on lateral stems, or "stolons" above the seed potato, it's necessary to "hill" the vines. When the
    green sprouts achieve 8 inches in height, bury all but their top 4 inches with soil, chopped straw, or shredded
    leaves. Hill again when potato plants grow another 8 inches. The more you hill, the more prolific your harvest is
    likely to be. I usually hill mine to a height of 18 inches. Stop hilling when the vines flower.

    Potato tubers, like vampires, need to live in darkness. In fact, they will turn green if exposed to light. And a
    green potato can cause sickness if consumed. Therefore it is absolutely essential to keep the tubers covered with
    soil or mulch.
